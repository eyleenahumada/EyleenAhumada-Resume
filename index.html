        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm a current second year Environmental Science major at UC Riverside. Although I am barely starting out in my professional journey to becoming an environmental scientist, I am passionate about my major and my future career. I became interested in environmental studies in high school while taking AP Environmental Science. I can credit much of my interest in this field to my teacher, who instilled a sense of purpose and calling for helping the environment in me. I chose UC Riverside on the basis that I was going to major in history. The decision to major in the science field was a last minute decision which was a scary choice to make, but which has ultimately been the best decision I have ever made.
 <br><br>

        Along with being passionate about the environment, I am also passionate about advocating for social justice. I was a member of CCEJ for two years as a camper and ultimately a youth leader.  The experience I had as a camper changed my perspective and the way I saw everyone around me. This experience enlightened me and as a result I became a part of the organization. This unique background has made much more aware of the systemic issues in this country.The current political climate has been interesting in recent times to say the least. I believe my background and education in the matters of social justice give me an insight and perspective into the lives of others. Although recent times have been heated, I firmly believe that the causes I support are for the betterment of the lives of minorities.
<br><br>

        In my short time as a student at UC Riverside, my experience has been unique to say the least. I, as well as my fellow students, are living through a pandemic. This is nothing anyone could have seen coming. COVID-19 affected the second part of my freshman year at college. My life, as well as everyone elseâ€™s, was disrupted and uprooted. The feeling of missing out on those last few months of my freshman year was a hard pill to swallow. Despite these circumstances I believe I have made the best out of a negative situation. Although online classes have been challenging and generally disliked, itâ€™s something that has put me out of my comfort zone. I have tried my best to switch to online learning and in the process I believe I have taken my education into my own hands despite the state of the world around me. This pandemic, despite putting my life on hold indefinitely, has been an enlightening experience. I have learned how to adapt to an unforeseen situation which I believe can ultimately benefit me in the long run in the workforce.
